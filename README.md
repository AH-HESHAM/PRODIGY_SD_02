A simple guessing game

## Guessing game
Challenge yourself with a number guessing game! The computer secretly picks a number between 0 and 1,000,000. Your job is to guess it! Each time you enter a number, you'll get a clue: higher if your guess is too big, or lower if it's too small. Keep guessing until you crack the code, and the game will reveal how many attempts it took you to win.

2. Players can guess the number by entering values in the GUI.
3. Feedback is provided after each guess, indicating if the guess is higher or lower than the secret number.
4. Once the player guesses correctly, the game displays the number of attempts it took to win.
5. The GUI is built using Java Swing components.
